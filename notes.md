    - Something I really enjoyed was the way the intructions were very clear and i was able to learn how to manuver and understand the importance of GitHub! Such as the following commands.

    - git pull - pulls from GitHub

    - git add . - adds to middle ground

    - git commit -am "" - commits to middle ground

    - git push - pushes to GitHub

    - git fetch - Fetches from GitHub

    - git status - Checks the balance between Git and term/VS Code

    - git config pull.rebase false - Fixes the imbalances
